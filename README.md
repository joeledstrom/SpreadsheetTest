_2014 Update: Repo has been abandoned since three years_

But since I noticed some people has forked/starred this repo over the years I decided to at least add a README. Also added my last uncommited changes that never made it to github before. 

This repository was originally created in response to a private email asking if I could share my code from this question: [Building model classes using @Key annotation...](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/google-api-java-client/UFy776f20q4/6YIiA8dyU2MJ)

The project I was working on at the time was rather quickly abandoned and I haven't touched this code since then.

After all the recent Google Drive changes i'd be amazed if this still works.

_Update 2:_ **Warning**: Please don't use this code in anything close to production. It's worse than bad.
